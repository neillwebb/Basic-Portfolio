        <p class="copy1">   Greetings! My name is Neill Webb. Im an aspiring web developer. While I am still a novice, I have a bright future ahead of me. I've never given up on myself and I think that is as important an attribute that a person can have. I was raised in the suburbs of Atlanta and came to the city of Atlanta when I was 18. I spent almost 3 years studying at Emory University. I studied philosophy and political science and loved it. Then, life happened. I experienced massive personal loss and was challenged in a way that I had never experienced before. Remember the part about never haven given up? That was a lie. I gave up. I quit school. I checked out on life. You don't need to know the details. This is obviously not going to be the text that I include in my portfolio but Im currently in a mood of self-pity considering how miserably I'm doing at executing this first homework assignment. I'm not going to give up. I'm going to put in a ton of work and get better at this.  
                        </p>
        <p>     The second paragraph is for positivity. I picked myself up after about 7 years of rock-bottom and decided that I was going to make the best of my life as it was. I was a bartender and was dedicated to being as good at that particular job that I possibly could be. I got a job at The Porter Beer Bar in Little 5 Points. The Porter is a craft beer bar/gastro pub that features a beer list of nearly 900 beers in a bottle and a draft beer list that changes daily. I was hired as a server and within 3 months was a manager. Within my first year, I was promoted to General Manager. I always want to continue to look ahead. I've worked 75 hours a week in my position for 9 months in order to afford to be in the position to financially afford to make this next step in my life. I stepped down from my position and only bartend 1 night a week(just for supplementary income) at this point. I'm a little overwhelmed but mostly excited about the opportunity to be here. Hopefully I can buy you all a beer once I successfully complete this program! Or-if you reference my poorly chosen picture with my girlfriend-a shot of tequila!
