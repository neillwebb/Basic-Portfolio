            Greetings! My name is Neill Webb. Im an aspiring web developer.
            While I am still a novice, I have a bright future ahead of me. I've
            never given up on myself and I think that is as important an
            attribute that a person can have. I was raised in the suburbs of
            Atlanta and came to the city of Atlanta when I was 18. I spent
            almost 3 years studying at Emory University. I studied philosophy
            and political science and loved it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a bartender and was dedicated to being as good at that
            particular job that I possibly could be. I got a job at The Porter
            Beer Bar in Little 5 Points. The Porter is a craft beer bar/gastro
            pub that features a beer list of nearly 900 beers in a bottle and a
            draft beer list that changes daily. I was hired as a server and
            within 3 months was a manager. Within my first year, I was promoted
            to General Manager. I always want to continue to look ahead. I've
            worked 75 hours a week in my position for 9 months in order to
            afford to be in the position to financially afford to make this next
            step in my life. I stepped down from my position and only bartend 1
            night a week(just for supplementary income) at this point. I'm a
            little overwhelmed but mostly excited about the opportunity to be
            here. Hopefully I can buy you all a beer once I successfully
            complete this program! Or-if you reference my poorly chosen picture
            with my girlfriend-a shot of tequila!
